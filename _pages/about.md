I recieved my M.S. degree in Computer Science at [Handong Global University](https://handong.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof. Charmgil Hong](https://charmgil.github.io/) in [Handong Artificial Intelligence Lab. (HAIL)](https://hail.handong.edu/), and I am currently **seeking Ph.D. opportunities**.

My current research interests lie in developing **intent-driven deep learning frameworks** to address fundamental challenges in medical AI.

In particular, I am interested in:
- Exploring **multimodal data fusion** strategies for robust and informative representation learning
- Constructing **anomaly detection** techniques informed by latent space understanding 

For more details about my academic background, publications, and research experiences, please refer to [Resume](/cv/) page.
